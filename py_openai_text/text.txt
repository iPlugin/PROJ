Iâ€™m 7 years old. My name is Masha. Every day I wake up at 7 a.m. and go to the bathroom. I brush my teeth, brush my hair and go to have some breakfast. My mother is a chef, so she cooks very well. My father is a doctor. He usually reads a paper in the morning. We have a cat. Its name is Bars. We are a small and happy family.
