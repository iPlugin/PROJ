GL_BaseCamp Hi everyone, I get the test â„–1.2:

[ Client/Server application to close processes on remote HOST ]

- the client gets the processes list and sends them by server request.
- the server will request to close one of the processes on the client's host.
- the client has to reply with success or failure.

===========================================================

[ For start, you need ]

*Installing*
- $ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
- $ sudo apt-get install nlohmann-json3-dev

*For compiling software code*
- $ make
